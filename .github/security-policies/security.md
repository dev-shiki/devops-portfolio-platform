# 🛡️ Security Policies for DevOps Portfolio Project

## Overview
This document outlines the security policies and practices implemented in this DevOps portfolio project. Our approach follows the "shift-left" security model, integrating security at every stage of the development lifecycle.

## 🔒 Security Principles

### 1. Defense in Depth
- Multiple layers of security controls
- Container security with non-root execution
- Network isolation and access controls
- Regular vulnerability scanning

### 2. Least Privilege Access
- Minimal permissions for all components
- Non-root container execution
- Restricted file system access
- Role-based access control (RBAC)

### 3. Security by Design
- Security considerations in architecture
- Secure coding practices
- Automated security testing
- Continuous monitoring

## 🔍 Security Controls

### Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- **Tool**: Snyk
- **Scope**: Source code vulnerability analysis
- **Frequency**: Every commit, PR, and nightly
- **Thresholds**: High severity findings block deployment

### Software Composition Analysis (SCA)
- **Tool**: Snyk + Trivy
- **Scope**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Frequency**: Weekly dependency updates via Dependabot
- **Policy**: No critical vulnerabilities in production

### Container Security
- **Base Images**: Alpine Linux (minimal attack surface)
- **User Context**: Non-root execution (user ID 10001)
- **Scanning**: Trivy for image vulnerabilities
- **Registry**: GitHub Container Registry with security scanning

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security
- **Kubernetes Manifests**: Security policy validation
- **Docker**: Security best practices enforcement
- **Secrets Management**: No hardcoded secrets policy

## 📋 Security Requirements

### Container Requirements
1. **Non-root Execution**: All containers must run as non-root user
2. **Minimal Base Images**: Use Alpine or distroless images
3. **Health Checks**: Implement container health checks
4. **Resource Limits**: Define CPU and memory limits
5. **Read-only File System**: Where possible, use read-only root filesystem

### Code Requirements
1. **No Hardcoded Secrets**: Use environment variables or secret management
2. **Input Validation**: Validate all external inputs
3. **Error Handling**: Secure error messages (no sensitive data exposure)
4. **Logging**: Implement security event logging
5. **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated and vulnerability-free

### CI/CD Requirements
1. **Branch Protection**: Require PR reviews for main branch
2. **Security Gates**: Fail builds on high/critical vulnerabilities
3. **Image Signing**: Sign container images (planned)
4. **SBOM Generation**: Software Bill of Materials (planned)
5. **Compliance Reporting**: Generate security compliance reports

## 🚨 Incident Response

### Vulnerability Response
1. **Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0)**: Fix within 24 hours
2. **High (CVSS 7.0-8.9)**: Fix within 7 days
3. **Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9)**: Fix within 30 days
4. **Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9)**: Fix within 90 days

### Security Alert Process
1. Automated vulnerability detection via Snyk/Trivy
2. GitHub Security Advisories for dependency alerts
3. Dependabot automatic PR creation for updates
4. Security team review and approval process

## 🔧 Tools and Technologies

### Security Scanning Tools
- **Snyk**: SAST and SCA scanning
- **Trivy**: Container and filesystem vulnerability scanning
- **Docker Bench Security**: Container runtime security
- **OPA (Open Policy Agent)**: Policy enforcement
- **GitHub Advanced Security**: Code scanning and secret detection

### Monitoring and Alerting
- **GitHub Security Tab**: Centralized vulnerability dashboard
- **SARIF Reports**: Standardized security findings format
- **Artifact Reports**: Detailed security scan results
- **PR Comments**: Automated security status updates

## 📊 Compliance and Reporting

### Regular Security Activities
- **Daily**: Automated security scans on commits
- **Weekly**: Dependency updates via Dependabot
- **Monthly**: Security policy review
- **Quarterly**: Security tooling assessment

### Metrics and KPIs
- Mean Time to Remediation (MTTR) for vulnerabilities
- Number of critical/high vulnerabilities in production
- Security scan coverage percentage
- Dependency freshness metrics
