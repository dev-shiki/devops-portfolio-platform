## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously and appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities via one of the following methods:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (Preferred)
   - Go to the [Security tab](../../security) of this repository
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Fill out the vulnerability details

2. **Email** (Alternative)
   - Send an email to: `security@portfolio-devops.local`
   - Include a detailed description of the vulnerability
   - Include steps to reproduce if applicable

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Type of issue** (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- **Full paths of source file(s)** related to the manifestation of the issue
- **The location of the affected source code** (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Any special configuration** required to reproduce the issue
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact of the issue**, including how an attacker might exploit it

### Response Timeline

We will respond to security vulnerability reports according to the following timeline:

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 7 days
- **Status Update**: Weekly updates until resolution
- **Resolution**: Based on severity level
  - Critical: Within 24 hours
  - High: Within 7 days  
  - Medium: Within 30 days
  - Low: Within 90 days

### What to Expect

After you submit a report, we will:

1. **Acknowledge** your report within 48 hours
2. **Assess** the vulnerability and its impact
3. **Develop** a fix for the issue
4. **Test** the fix thoroughly
5. **Release** the fix according to our timeline
6. **Publicly disclose** the vulnerability (with your permission)

### Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

- We will not take legal action against researchers who:
  - Make a good-faith effort to avoid privacy violations
  - Comply with this security policy
  - Report vulnerabilities promptly
  - Avoid intentionally degrading our services

- We will:
  - Respond to your report promptly
  - Work with you to understand and resolve the issue
  - Recognize your contribution (if you wish)

### Bug Bounty

This is a portfolio project and we do not currently offer monetary rewards for vulnerability reports. However, we will:

- Acknowledge your contribution in our security acknowledgments
- Provide a letter of recommendation for your responsible disclosure (upon request)
- Consider you for future security-related opportunities

## Security Features

This project implements several security measures:

### Automated Security Scanning
- **SAST (Static Application Security Testing)** with Snyk
- **SCA (Software Composition Analysis)** for dependency vulnerabilities
- **Container scanning** with Trivy
- **Secrets detection** in code and containers

### Development Security
- **Dependabot** for automated dependency updates
- **Security policies** enforcement in CI/CD
- **Container security** with non-root execution
- **Vulnerability gates** in deployment pipeline

### Infrastructure Security
- **Kubernetes security** best practices
- **Network policies** and service isolation
- **Resource limits** and security contexts
- **Image scanning** before deployment

## Security Best Practices

When contributing to this project, please follow these security guidelines:

### Code Security
- Never commit secrets, API keys, or passwords
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Validate all user inputs
- Implement proper error handling
- Follow the principle of least privilege

### Container Security
- Use non-root users in containers
- Keep base images updated
- Minimize attack surface
- Implement health checks
- Use specific version tags (not `latest`)

### Dependencies
- Keep dependencies updated
- Review security advisories
- Use known secure packages
- Monitor for vulnerabilities

## Security Contact

For security-related questions or concerns:

- **Security Team**: security@portfolio-devops.local
- **DevOps Team**: devops@portfolio-devops.local
- **Project Maintainer**: @portfolio-maintainer

## Acknowledgments

We appreciate the security research community and will acknowledge security researchers who help improve our security posture through responsible disclosure.

### Hall of Fame

Currently no security researchers to acknowledge, but we welcome contributions!
